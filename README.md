# Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading System :iphone: :computer:

## :no_entry: DO NOT USE THIS TO TRADE AS THIS SYSTEM IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! :no_entry:

### Description
This is a trading system I developed with Python (backend) and React.js (frontend) which I then uploaded to Google Cloud in order to monitor my trades on the go. The strategy in this system does not work as it ran out of alpha. However, this is a good blueprint to develop a trading system which may be profitable, which is why I have open sourced this for the community to improve upon.
